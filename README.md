This current project will entail me making a barebones html website focusing on recipes.

Once i have completed this website i believe i will have displayed my proficiency in basic html techniques, aswell as exhibiting a basic understanding using git and gitgub to be able to make/clone repositories and pushing modified projects onto github via git
